<h1>Static files</h1>

<p>
  Put any random file here (html, json, whatever) and it will be served on
  http://localhost:8000/random-file.html
</p>

<p>
  Supposing you want to serve static json files, place here. And your cors
  headers will be applied nicely. See stock.json, and
  http://localhost:8000/stock.json
</p>
